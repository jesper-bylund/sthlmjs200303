# svelte demo for SthlmJS on 20.03.03

This is a very quick demo of SvelteJs for a (talk I gave at SthlmJS)[https://www.jesperbylund.com/talks/sthlmjs03] on the 3rd of march 2020.

## Get started

_Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed._

Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
